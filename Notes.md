# Project Notes: TWL UPS Invoice Parser

## Project Goal
We are a small logistic company running several FedEx/UPS accounts. Our customers make use of our accounts by a plateform "YiDiDa". Every week after FedEx/UPS generate invoice, we have to re-arrange raw data, allocate cost for each customer, and calculate charges accordingly. Also we have to upload cost and charge amount to YiDiDa for customer lookup. This project is designed to deal with raw UPS invoice data instead of manual handling by spreadsheets.
